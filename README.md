# Wheel Deal Rental [E-commerce]

The main idea of this project is to make the online rental more accessible to the users. Everything will be done online, so the only thing left for the user would be to go and take the booked vehicle.

There are two roles: Admin, User.

This project has microservices, authentication, authorization, login & register, and other options like listing locations, listing vehicles.

For the users, there is also shopping cart, options to check if available and book the vehicle and add review for every vehicle with review text and stars, options for paying after booking(Stripe), download a pdf form as a proof for the successful payment and receive email as a comfirmation.

For the admins there are oprions to add, edit and delete locations and vehicles.

There is second application for the admin for managing with the orders. After the vehicle is returned, the order would be deleted.

What is used: .Net Core(with Razor syntax) + Bootstrap + Jquery + SQL Server Express.
